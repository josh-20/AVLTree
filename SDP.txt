Software Development Plan

1. Requitments Specifications:
	- Change all variable names to be meaningful names.
	- Make comments
	- implement deleteMin function.
	- re-Arrange program one to use an avl tree as a que instead of a binary search tree.

2. System Analysis:
	- Create a program that reuses program one's code to speed up results in finding a word through a word ladder.
	- write a deleteMin function that deletes the smallest value in the avl tree.

3. Seystem Design:
	- DeleteMin Function: Itterate down the left side of the tree until i find the smallest value then i want to null it out.
